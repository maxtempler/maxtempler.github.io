title: Blogging about workout apps
---

Here I am trying to evaluate different workout apps.


Looking into the following apps:
- [MuscleBooster] (http://musclebooster.fitness/)
- BodyFast
- SHRED
- [Fitbod] (https://www.fitbod.me/)
- [FitnessAi] (https://www.getfitnessai.com/)
- BodBot
- AsanaRebel
- Volt

What I want to look into and how do I am scouting the apps?
- signing up
- trial out phase
- easy of use
- flexibility
- price
- usability
